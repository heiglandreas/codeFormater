What is it?
-----------
A script to create zf1-style classes from namespaced classes

I have been inspired to create this script by the requirement to use 
PHP5.2 for a productive system but the urge to develop with PHP5.3
and its benefits.

So I had to find a way to create classes that could be used with 
PHP5.2 from namespaced PHP-Classes.

So from this class::

	<?php
	namespace \Foo
	
	class Bar {}

the script makes this class::

	<?php
	
	class Foo_Bar {}

The script also takes care of putting the new Class-Files into the
correct location.
So the above class \Foo\Bar with this path::

	Foo/Bar/Bar.php

will be put into the new Location::

	Foo/Bar.php

Usage
-----
::

	despace.php [options] <srcfile/srcfolder> <dstfolder>
	
where ``<srcfile/srcfolder>`` is the file (or the folder when using the 
recursive switch) containing the namespaced classes that shall be 
transformed.

``<dstfolder>`` is the folder where the transformed files shall be stored 
at. If files already exist, the existing file will be renamed, so if you 
want to get rid of old stuff, make sure it is removed *before* you call 
this script.

The following options are available

--recursive, -r  go recursively through the given directory. This switch
				 only makes sense, when specifying a directory as 
				 ``<srcfile/srcfolder>``.
--version, -V	 display the version of the script.
--verbose, -v    output more informations along the transformation.
